The Image Source Control manages image sources, displays them and warns if they are missing.

== Description ==

Did you ever forget to add the source to an image file in the frontend and the lawyer of the copyright holder knocked on your door?

Image Source Control (ISC) helps to prevent this situation.

For changes in WordPress 5.0 and the block editor see [this post](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/gutenberg-support-27/).

**Image Sources Lists**

You can choose between different image source list types:

* source as image caption/overlay (not compatible with all themes)
* source list below the content
* combined source list of all images

**Frontend Features**

* display sources for images in content, galleries, shortcodes and featured images
* show image source directly in the image (not working with all images and themes)
* include a list with all images and their sources of the current page/post
* include a list with all images and their sources with all images or only those included in posts
* attach lists be the content automatically or using shortcodes or template functions
* display image sources on archive pages

**Backend Features**

* manage image source within media dashboard
* mark an image to belong to the uploader
* lists images with missing sources in the backend
* warnings, if image source is missing
* link sources to any url
* manage, display and link licenses

**Localization**

English, German

== Instructions ==

Also have a look at the [image source control website](http://webgilde.com/en/image-source-control/image-source-control-manual/).

Find a list of images with missing sources under _Media > Missing sources_

**automatic image sources**

You can choose to display image sources automatically below the post content or as a small overlay above your images. Just visit the settings page of the plugin to enable those options.

**manually included image sources on pages/posts**

You can add the image source list manually to pages or post via the shortcode `[isc_list]` in your content editor. You can use `[isc_list id="123]` to show the list of any post or page.

You can also add the list with the function `isc_list()` within the loop in your template files. Use `isc_list( $post_id )` to show the image source list outside the loop.

You should also check first if the function exists before using it:
`<?php if( function_exists('isc_list') ) { isc_list(); } ?>`

**list all image sources**

You can add a paginated list with ALL attachments and sources to a post or page using the shortcode `[isc_list_all]`. Use `[isc_list_all per_page="25"]` to show only a limited number of images per page.

The plugin searches your post content and thumbnail for images (attachments) and lists them, if you included at least the image source or marked it as your own image.
