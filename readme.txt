Show image credits, image captions, and copyrights. Manage image sources and warn if they are missing. The original plugin since 2012.

== Description ==

Are you concerned about being held liable for violating copyright law and would like to start crediting owners properly?

Do you want to give back to photographers and illustrators by adding image credits, so they are rightfully attributed?

Or are you a creator yourself and want to show information on the picture licenses for your image gallery under which publishers can use or purchase your work?

Image Source Control is your go-to solution when it comes to handling copyright-protected photos and illustrations.

**Image Credit layouts**

Choose between different credit displays:

* List all image sources below the content of a specific page or place the list manually
* Show an image caption overlay above or below the image
* Embed a complete image credit list with thumbnails on your website

**Frontend Features**

* Display image credits in the content, for image galleries, images added by shortcodes, and featured images
* … see more listed under Premium features below
* Define the layout and position of the caption overlay
* Show the image source fully, or only on click or mouseover
* Attach the Per-page list automatically, by using a shortcode, or with a PHP function
* Display image sources on archive pages
* Link to the copyright holder and include a link to the image license

**Backend Features**

* Add credits for any image file uploaded to the Media library
* Dedicated image source fields for the following blocks: Image, Cover Image, Featured Image, Media & Text
* Quickly assign a centrally defined source to any image and choose three options: hide image sources for these images, show a specific source (e.g., your name), or the uploader’s name
* Warn about missing image sources
* Manage, display, and link available licenses

**Featured Image Caption**

ISC Lite works for Featured Images. By default, you will see the image credits options in the media library and the featured image options in the block editor.

The featured image caption shows in the Per-page list with all other image sources on the page.

Check out the premium features to display the image caption overlay for featured images.

- Bulk delete unused images
- Filter the list by various states

[See Pricing](https://imagesourcecontrol.com/pricing/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=pricing).

== Instructions ==

Take a look at the [Image Source Control Documentation](https://imagesourcecontrol.com/documentation/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=documentation).

Find a list of missing images sources and other debug tools under _Media > Image sources_

You can choose to display image sources below the post content or as a small caption overlay above your images. Just visit the settings page of the plugin to enable those options.

**Manually included image sources on pages/posts**

You can add the Per-page list manually to pages or posts via the shortcode `[isc_list]` in your content editor or a text widget.

Use `[isc_list id="123"]` to show the list of any post or page.

Use the PHP code `<?php if( function_exists('isc_list') ) { isc_list(); } ?>` within your template files.

**List all image sources**

You can add a paginated list with ALL attachments and sources attached to posts and pages—the Global list—using the shortcode `[isc_list_all]`.

Use `[isc_list_all per_page="25"]` to show only a limited number of images per page.

Use `[isc_list_all included="all"]` to show all attachments in the list, including those not explicitly attached to a post.

The plugin searches your post content and thumbnail for images (attachments) and lists them if you included at least the image source or marked it to use the default image source.

**Remove “nofollow” from all source links**

In order to remove “nofollow” from source links, follow the [instructions in our documentation](https://imagesourcecontrol.com/documentation/#remove-nofollow-from-all-source-links).
