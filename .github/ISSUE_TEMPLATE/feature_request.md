This template is meant to help to define a new feature or behavior that can be **experienced** by the user. I.e., improvements in our code that are not experienced by normal users go to **maintenance**.

**Summary**

Start with a summary that briefly describes what this is about.

Current solution
---

A clear and concise description with step-by-step instructions, if there is a current behavior that needs changing.

If there is a behavior that is not optimal, set up a test site and link to it. Still, provide the steps you did on that test site.

What is the worse, but a realistic case for not implementing a change?

Expected behavior
---

It helps a lot if you could add a mockup for the layout, screenshots from solutions that already work, or links to resources that explain this.
The more you add here, compared to using external resources, the faster someone can work on this.

Priority
---

The following questions might help when estimating the priority.

- Is there an alternative solution?
- Quantify the number of requests for this
- Describe the pain our users (or we) are experiencing with the current solution.

Additional information
---

Links to external resources and documentation if applicable.

Tests
---

Define checklists of a) positive behavior b) behavior that should not have changed.
Use `- [ ] ` so that one can quickly mark them as resolve.
